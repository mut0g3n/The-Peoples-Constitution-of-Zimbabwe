The-Peoples-Constitution-of-Zimbabwe
====================================

A crowd sourced constitution for the people of Zimbabwe

This project is motivated by three things:

1. The horribly flawed constitution making process currently ongoing in Zimbabwe.

2. The recent crowd sourcing of the new Icelandic constitution where more than 50% of the population of Iceland contributed or made comment during the drafting of the document.

3. Clay Shirky's recent TED talk on the possibility of using massively open version control systems such as github for democratic purposes. See: http://tinyurl.com/car4c9r

The Objective
=============

1. Create a parallel constitution making process based around a completly open platform (such as github) so that all Zimbabweans (and potentially others) can have a say in the writing of a new consitution for Zimbabwe.

The "How"
=========

1. Github is envisaged as the platform in which the consitution itself can be written through massive open participation. 

2. Other social media (eg. Facebook) could be used in parallel for mutiple purposes: advertisement, debate, polling issues etc.

The Who
=======

1. As stated everyone and anyone expecially Zimbabweans can contribute to this.
