The-Peoples-Constitution-of-Zimbabwe
====================================

A crowd sourced constitution for the people of Zimbabwe

This project is motivated by three things:

1. The horribly flawed constitution making process currently ongoing in Zimbabwe.

2. The recent crowd sourcing of the new Icelandic constitution where more than 50% of the population of Iceland contributed or made comment during the drafting of the document.

3. Clay Shirky's recent TED talk on the possibility of using massively open version control systems such as github for democratic purposes. See: http://tinyurl.com/car4c9r
